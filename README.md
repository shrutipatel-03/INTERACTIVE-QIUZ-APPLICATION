*Task Description: Interactive Quiz Application

The objective of this project is to build a responsive and interactive Quiz Application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application will allow users to attempt a series of questions, receive instant feedback after answering each question, and view their final score at the end of the quiz. The quiz content should be dynamically loaded, meaning questions and options will not be hard-coded but fetched from a structured format like an array of objects or external JSON.

Key Features:
Dynamic Question Loading
Questions, options, and correct answers should be stored in a data structure (e.g., array or JSON), and loaded into the interface dynamically using JavaScript.

Instant Feedback
After a user selects an answer, the application should immediately display whether the chosen option was correct or incorrect, along with a brief explanation if available.

Scoring System
The app should maintain a score counter that updates in real-time as users progress through the quiz.

Responsive Design
The interface should be visually appealing and mobile-friendly, ensuring a smooth user experience on all devices.

Completion Summary
Once the quiz is complete, the user should be shown a summary of their performance, including the number of correct answers and the final score.

Certificate Notification
The app should include a message notifying users that a Completion Certificate will be issued on the internship end date by CodTech.

Deliverables:
A fully functional and polished web application.

Clean and readable source code.

Hosted demo or screenshots of the working app (optional but recommended).*
